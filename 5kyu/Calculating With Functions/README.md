## Calculating with functions
Write calculations using functions and get the results.

### Requirements:
- There must be a function for each number from 0 ("zero") to 9 ("nine")
- There must be a function for each of the following mathematical operations: plus, minus, times, dividedBy (divided_by in Ruby)
- Each calculation consist of exactly one operation and two numbers
- The most outer function represents the left operand, the most inner function represents the right operand
- Divison should be integer division, e.g eight(dividedBy(three()))/eight(divided_by(three)) should return 2, not 2.666666...

### Examples:
```
seven(times(five())) => 35
four(plus(nine())) => 13
eight(minus(three())) => 5
six(dividedBy(two())) => 3
